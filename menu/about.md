I'm Krithik Vaidya, the author of this blog. I'm currently in the junior year of my Bachelor's degree (B.Tech in Information Technology) at NITK Surathkal. I've always been inclined towards technical writing, and this blog is where I get to express this interest. There's no set theme of topics for the blog, I'll be writing about whatever I'm exploring at the time or am interested in writing about. Since it's a relatively newer blog, there aren't many articles up yet. More articles are coming up though, promise!

All thanks to [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul) for the minimalist Jekyll Pages theme atop which this blog is built.
