I'm Krithik Vaidya, the author of this blog. I currently work as a Software Engineer II at Intuit. I've always been inclined towards technical writing, and this blog is where I get to express this interest. There's no set theme of topics for the blog - I'll be writing about whatever I'm exploring at the time. Thank you for visiting!

All thanks to [Paul Le](https://github.com/LeNPaul) for the minimalist Jekyll Pages theme atop which this blog is built.
